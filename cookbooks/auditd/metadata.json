  "long_description": "Description\n===========\nA simple cookbook to install auditd and provided rulesets. Rulesets\nincluded in the OS auditd/audit package as examples are based on 4\nestablished standards:\n\n* [Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP)](http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/capp.pdf)\n* [Labeled Security Protection Profile (LSPP)](http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/lspp.pdf)\n* [National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)](http://www.fas.org/sgp/library/nispom.htm)\n* [Security Technical Implementation Guides](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/stig/index.html)\n\nThe OS package provides the client side tools for working with the\nlinux kernel audit framework.\n\nRequirements\n============\nLinux : any distribution in theory, but only Ubuntu and RHEL 6 have been tested.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n* node['auditd']['ruleset'] - ruleset to use, either \"default\" (the default if\n  unset) or one of the provided examples\n\t* NOTE: When using this recipe on RHEL systems, you're restricted to the \"default\" or \"cis\" rulesets, as RHEL uses version-specific paths for the .rules which we can't programatically determine at this time.\n* node['auditd']['backlog'] - backlog size, default is 320 should be\nlarger for busy systems\n\nUsage\n=====\nIf you're using one of the default rulesets set the correct attribute\nbased on the ruleset desired, one of:\n\n* \"capp\" : Controlled Access Protection Profile\n* \"lspp\" : Labeled Security Protection Profile\n* \"nispom\" : National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) \n* \"stig\" : Security Technical Implementation Guides \n* \"cis\"  : Center for Internet Security auditd recommendations\n\nAnd include `recipe[auditd::rules]` in your run list. You can also set\nthe attribute `node['auditd']['ruleset']` to the name of a custom rule\ntemplate to be used instead of one of the default rules.\n\nIf you are using the recipe from a wrapper cookbook, include the\ndefault recipe `recipe[auditd]` to setup the service and use the\n`auditd_ruleset` resource to place your custom rule template.\n\nTODO\n====\nIdeally the auditd_ruleset resource could make use of a data bag\nsearch to build the data driven ruleset\n\nMake builtins an array attribute to allow user updates without\ncookbook release.\n",
